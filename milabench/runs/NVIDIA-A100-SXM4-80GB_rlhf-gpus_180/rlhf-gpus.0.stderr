Some weights of GPTNeoXForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at EleutherAI/pythia-160m and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

[rank0]:[W1211 17:58:32.492815473 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1168] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
