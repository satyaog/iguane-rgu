It will be set to `True` by default. This behavior will be depracted in transformers v4.45, and will be then set to `False` by default.

Some weights of GPTNeoXForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at EleutherAI/pythia-160m and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
